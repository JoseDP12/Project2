		    <p>The running back position can be considered one of the more physical position in football as the running back will always up end tackled unless they score. For those not familar, this position is one of the position in the offense side of football where the object of these 11 players is to score the ball in the opponents endzone. The running back postion usually receives the ball from a direct handoff by their quarterback. Their objective is to carry the ball foward using speed, agility, balance to avoid the incoming defenders trying to tackle them.</p>

		  <p>I choose to talk about this position in paticular because it was the primary position I played on my high school football team and I got very familiar with the position and actually watched professional running backs in the National Football League in attempts to learn and mirror the postive things they do to get better at my "craft". This actually was a great thing to do as I continued to improve my skills at the position each week and ultimately became the leading scorer on the team and winning the team MVP aware at the end of the season!</p>
